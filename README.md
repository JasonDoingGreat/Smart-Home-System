# Smart-Home-System
This is my undergraduate graduation project of designing smart home system using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL.

In the web page, there are some Chinese characters.

It realized functions like login, check login status, show captured video images in real-time, show current time, etc.

This project is naive with few pages and functions which may not be enough for home security system. The UI design is somehow naive as well which needs further improvements.

Anyone who has any comments on this project please contact me via lzzduke06@gmail.com.
